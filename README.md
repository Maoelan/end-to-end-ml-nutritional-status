<!--# END TO END MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT NUTRITIONAL STATUS OF CHILDREN (STATUS GIZI ANAK)
## THIS PROJECT FOR MY UNDERGRADUATE THESIS (S.Kom / B.Sc) INSTITUT TEKNOLOGI NASIONAL MALANG


Here, I created an end-to-end machine learning project to determine the nutritional status of children, which consists of 3 labels: "GIZI LEBIH(OVERNUTRITION), GIZI BAIK(GOOD NUTRITION), GIZI KURANG(UNDERNUTRITION)"

I used two different algorithms, namely the K-Means and K-Medoids clustering algorithms, to compare the results.

- For the backend, I used Python Flask.
- For training the dataset, I utilized the sklearn.cluster library's KMeans and KMedoids.
(This project only displays the training results).
- For the frontend, I used React.js with the Argon Dashboard React template.
- I also compared the results with the manual calculations I performed in Microsoft Excel.-->
